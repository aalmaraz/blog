I'm writing things again, I decided to move my old [blog](http://betottoarq.blogspot.com/) 
from blogger to GitHub pages, for flexibility and for learning something new. 

This is the first version and the first style, I will try to improve in design, 
but that's the most difficult part for me.

I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to create the blog, it's powerful and flexible 
and once you have it configured very easy to use, the best part is that if you are a good designer, 
you can create awesome sites and include many javascript features as you want, because at the end, 
is just a webpage.

I like the way to create posts only through Markdown, I think is useful and it just works. 
The second objective of this blog is to improve my English grammar, so if you're reading this,
you notice a grammar error and you want to help me, please create an issue here:
